## Comments

# Avoid adding comments that merely restate the code.
# Focus comments on explaining the 'why' behind non-obvious logic or design decisions.

## Commented-out Code

# Do not leave commented-out code in the final version.
# Use version control (like Git) to track history instead of commenting out old code.
